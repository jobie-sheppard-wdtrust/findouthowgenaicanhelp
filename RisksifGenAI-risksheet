Risk list — Risk interaction 

Theme code: KFP 

KFP-01 

Risk ID: KFP-01 

Behaviour implied by spec: Highlighted phrases "behave like clickable text" and are activated by click. Other interactive controls — preset prompt button, "Send" icon button, risk pop-up close "–" — are similarly defined only as click-activated, with no explicit keyboard focus or activation behaviour specified. 

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): If any of these interactive controls (highlighted phrases, preset prompt button, "Send" icon button, pop-up close "–") are implemented as mouse-only (e.g., as non-focusable elements, or not activatable by Enter/Space), keyboard users may be unable to reach or activate them, and may not get a visible focus indicator. Risks include 2.1.1 Keyboard (A), 2.4.3 Focus Order (A), 2.4.7 Focus Visible (AA), 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (A). 

Level of risk: High 

Spec evidence (exact): "Highlighted phrases/blocks inside specific bot responses (clickable text with highlight background rgba(248, 113, 113, 0.2))" 
"WHEN the bot response … phrases are visually highlighted … and behave like clickable text" 
"WHEN the user clicks a highlighted phrase/block…" 
"Preset prompt button (1)" 
""Send" control (icon button)" 
"Close/dismiss control with label: "–"" 

KFP-02 

Risk ID: KFP-02 

Behaviour implied by spec: Risk pop-up opens on clicking a highlight; scrolling is locked until dismissed; dismissal is via clicking “–” or highlighted text (clicking outside does not close). 

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): If the pop-up is not fully operable by keyboard (e.g., no focusable close control, no Escape handling, focus not managed), users can be blocked from completing the journey. Risks include 2.1.1 Keyboard (A), 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap (A), 2.4.3 Focus Order (A), 2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum) (AA) (pop-up/scroll-lock can obscure focused content), 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (A). 

Level of risk: High 

Spec evidence (exact): “Page scrolling and chat scrolling are disabled until dismissed.”“WHEN the risk pop-up is open, THEN clicking the “–” control closes the pop-up and restores scrolling”“WHEN the risk pop-up is open, clicking outside the pop-up does not close it. Only the “-“ control or clicking another highlighted section.” 

KFP-03 

Risk ID: KFP-03 

Behaviour implied by spec: The clicked preset button is removed; preset prompt buttons are hidden during typing; the input becomes deactivated after the bot response. 

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): Removing/hiding the currently-focused control without specifying where focus goes can cause focus loss or unexpected focus jumps. If focus ends up “lost” or placed behind an overlay, keyboard users may struggle. Risk includes 2.4.3 Focus Order (A). 

Level of risk: Medium 

Spec evidence (exact): “The clicked preset button is removed.”“Preset prompt buttons are hidden.”“After bot response appears… Input field becomes deactivated and will not accept custom text.” 

KFP-05 

Risk ID: KFP-05 

Behaviour implied by spec: Interactive actions are defined as occurring on “click” (preset button, highlighted phrases, pop-up controls), but the spec does not define whether activation occurs on pointer down, pointer up, or whether cancellation is possible. 

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): If activation occurs on pointer down (without allowing users to cancel before release), this may fail 2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation (A), which requires that down-event activation either not be used or be reversible/confirmable. 

Level of risk: Medium 

Spec evidence (exact): “WHEN the user clicks the preset prompt button…” “WHEN the user clicks a highlighted phrase/block…” “WHEN the risk pop-up is open, THEN clicking the “–” control closes the pop-up…” 

Theme code: SRA 

SRA-01 

Risk ID: SRA-01 

Behaviour implied by spec: Message input is described via placeholder text; no explicit label is specified. 

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): If implemented with placeholder-only (no associated label), screen reader users may not get a stable, programmatic label for the input, and instructions may be missed. Risks include 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A), 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (A), 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (A). 

Level of risk: High 

Spec evidence (exact): “Message input (multi-line)”“Placeholder: “Type your message...”” 

SRA-02 

Risk ID: SRA-02 

Behaviour implied by spec: “Send” is an icon button; risk pop-up close/dismiss control has label “–”. 

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): Icon-only and symbol-only controls commonly ship without meaningful accessible names (or with a name that doesn’t match the visible label). Risks include 1.1.1 Non-text Content (A), 2.5.3 Label in Name (A), 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (A). 

Level of risk: High 

Spec evidence (exact): ““Send” control (icon button)”“Close/dismiss control with label: “–”” 

SRA-03 

Risk ID: SRA-03 

Behaviour implied by spec: Bot typing indicator appears; bot response appears after 2000ms; highlighted phrases become clickable in staged phases (+800ms, +1600ms). 

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): If dynamic updates (typing indicator start/end, message insertion, highlight activation, pop-up open/close) are not announced appropriately to assistive tech, users may not know content changed. Risks include 4.1.3 Status Messages (AA) (and potentially 1.3.1 (A) if message relationships aren’t programmatically clear). 

Level of risk: High 

Spec evidence (exact): “Typing indicator (bot avatar + 3 dots) shown during preset response delay”“After 2000ms, the bot response appears.”“highlight activation staged in three phases (immediate, +800ms, +1600ms)” 

SRA-04 

Risk ID: SRA-04 

Behaviour implied by spec: Chat transcript uses visual “message rows”, avatars, and chat bubbles to distinguish bot vs user. 

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): If bot/user identity is conveyed mainly visually (avatars/placement/colors) without programmatic cues, screen reader users may not reliably distinguish speaker or structure. Risks include 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A) and 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (A) (for any custom components used to represent messages/roles). 

Level of risk: Medium 

Spec evidence (exact): “Chat transcript area”“Message rows (bot and user)”“Avatars …” 

SRA-05 

Risk ID: SRA-05 

Behaviour implied by spec: Controls become “disabled” / “deactivated” / reject input, but the spec does not define how those states are conveyed programmatically (only describes the behaviour). 

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): If disabled/readonly states are conveyed only visually (or not exposed via accessibility APIs), assistive tech users may be told a control is available when it isn’t, or may not understand why actions do nothing. Risk includes 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (A) and 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A). 

Level of risk: High 

Spec evidence (exact): ““Send” control is disabled if the input is empty/whitespace.” “After bot response appears, typing state ends. Input field becomes deactivated and will not accept custom text.” “WHEN the message input is empty (or only whitespace), THEN the “send” control is disabled, WITHIN immediate.” “WHEN the user tries to type a custom message input, THEN the input box does not accept this custom input to be typed in, WITHIN immediate.” 

SRA-06 

Risk ID: SRA-06 

Behaviour implied by spec: The UI includes non-text visuals (avatars and icons, including an attachment icon), but the spec does not state whether they have appropriate text alternatives or are explicitly marked as decorative. 

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): If these visuals convey meaning (e.g., who is speaking, “attachment”), and are implemented without appropriate text alternatives / programmatic exposure, users of assistive tech may miss the information. Risk includes 1.1.1 Non-text Content (A) (and can overlap with 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (A) if custom SVG/icon elements are used without appropriate accessibility semantics). 

Level of risk: Medium 

Spec evidence (exact): “Avatars (bot avatar uses background #90278e; user avatar uses primary accent)” “Bot/user icon inside avatar: 1.25rem × 1.25rem.” “Attachment icon size: 1rem × 1rem.” 

SRA-07 

Risk ID: SRA-07 

Behaviour implied by spec: The layout is structured into named regions (title bar, scrollable messages area, footer) and the title bar contains header and helper text, but no ARIA landmark roles or heading levels are specified for any of these regions or text elements. 

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): If the page is implemented without landmark regions (e.g. main, banner, region) and without heading-level markup for the title content, screen reader users cannot navigate by landmarks or headings, and the structural relationships of sections are not programmatically expressed. Risk includes 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A) (structural relationships not conveyed programmatically). 

Level of risk: Medium 

Spec evidence (exact): Vague in the spec — layout regions and title content are described only visually ("Title bar at the top of the chat window", "Scrollable messages area below the title bar", "Footer area below the message area", "Header text: 'GenAI Chatbot'", "Helper text: 'See the risks when GenAI helps with this task'") with no semantic role or heading-level requirements stated. 

SRA-08 

Risk ID: SRA-08 

Behaviour implied by spec: The risk pop-up behaves as a modal: it locks page and chat scrolling, requires a specific control to dismiss, and prevents interacting with background content by any means other than clicking another highlight in the same group. However, the spec defines no ARIA modal dialog semantics for the pop-up container. 

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): If the pop-up is implemented without role="dialog", aria-modal="true", and an aria-labelledby reference to its header ("Spotting hidden risks"), screen reader users in virtual/browse mode will not be informed they are inside a modal dialog. They may navigate past the pop-up into obscured background content without realising the interaction is locked, and the pop-up will not be announced as a dialog on open. This is a distinct AT-announcement failure from the keyboard focus concern in KFP-02. Risks include 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (A) (pop-up container has no programmatic role), and 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A) (the modal relationship between the pop-up and the locked background content is not programmatically expressed). 

Level of risk: High 

Spec evidence (exact): "WHEN the user clicks a highlighted phrase/block, THEN a risk pop-up appears titled 'Hidden Risk:'" and "Page scrolling and chat scrolling are disabled until dismissed." and "WHEN the risk pop-up is open, clicking outside the pop-up does not close it. Only the '-' control or clicking another highlighted section." 

SRA-09 

Risk ID: SRA-09 

Behaviour implied by spec: The risk pop-up title for the "Hallucination and Bias" group uses bold on either "Hallucination" or "Bias" specifically to indicate which risk type applies to the clicked highlight — the two highlights in the same group each display the same phrase but with a different word bolded. 

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): If the bold distinction is implemented using only CSS font-weight rather than semantic markup (e.g. <strong>) or a programmatically distinct accessible name or label on the title, screen reader users will hear the same text ("Hallucination and Bias") for both pop-ups with no indication of which term is being emphasised, losing the meaningful distinction the spec explicitly encodes through bold. Risk includes 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A) (information conveyed by visual text formatting is not available in a programmatic form). 

Level of risk: Medium 

Spec evidence (exact): "Custom text: Hallucination and Bias (with 'Hallucination' bold)" and "Custom text: Hallucination and Bias (with 'Bias' bold)" 

Theme code: LRZ 

LRZ-01 

Risk ID: LRZ-01 

Behaviour implied by spec: Full-height layout (100vh) with an internal scroll area for messages; input has max height 200px. 

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): Fixed-height layouts with nested scrolling can break reflow and text resize scenarios (320px width / 400% zoom), create “scroll traps”, or require excessive scrolling to access controls/content. Risks include 1.4.10 Reflow (AA) and 1.4.4 Resize Text (AA) (and potentially 1.4.12 Text Spacing (AA) if spacing changes cause clipping in fixed-height regions). 

Level of risk: Medium 

Spec evidence (exact): “Full-height layout: height 100vh.”“The message area scrolls vertically (overflow-y: auto).”“Input max-height: 200px.” 

LRZ-02 

Risk ID: LRZ-02 

Behaviour implied by spec: While the risk pop-up is open, scrolling is disabled; the pop-up position is only calculated on open (no defined reposition on resize). 

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): At small viewports/zoom, the pop-up can obscure relevant content, and scroll-lock can prevent reaching obscured content. If the pop-up can’t be repositioned on resize/zoom, it may end up partially off-screen. Risks include 1.4.10 Reflow (AA) and 2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum) (AA). 

Level of risk: High 

Spec evidence (exact): “When the risk pop-up is open, scrolling is disabled (page + chat scroll area) until dismissed, which can prevent reading other messages if the pop-up obscures them.”“Risk pop-up position is only calculated when it opens (no defined re-position on resize without re-opening).” 

LRZ-03 

Risk ID: LRZ-03 

Behaviour implied by spec: The layout is defined as “Full-height layout: height 100vh.” but the spec does not state that both portrait and landscape orientations must be supported. 

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): If a developer restricts the interaction to a single screen orientation (e.g., portrait only) or shows a “rotate device” block, this could fail 1.3.4 Orientation (AA), which requires content to not restrict its view and operation to a single orientation unless essential. 

Level of risk: Low 

Spec evidence (exact): “Full-height layout: height 100vh.” 

LRZ-04 

Risk ID: LRZ-04 

Behaviour implied by spec: The close/dismiss control is labelled "–" (a single character) and highlighted phrases are inline text acting as click targets. The spec does not define minimum dimensions for any interactive target. 

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): If interactive targets (particularly the "–" close control, inline highlighted phrases, and the Send icon button) are rendered smaller than 24 × 24 CSS pixels and do not meet the spacing exception, they will fail 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum) (AA). Single-character controls and inline text targets are especially likely to fall below this threshold. 

Level of risk: Medium 

Spec evidence (exact): "Close/dismiss control with label: "–"" 
"Highlighted phrases/blocks inside specific bot responses (clickable text with highlight background rgba(248, 113, 113, 0.2))" 
""Send" control (icon button)" 

Theme code: MTI 

MTI-01 

Risk ID: MTI-01 

Behaviour implied by spec: Preset auto-fills then auto-sends after a fixed delay (1400ms + 300ms) without further user action. 

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): Auto-submission on a timer can be treated as an unexpected timed change and may reduce user control. Risk areas include 3.2.2 On Input (A) (unexpected change of context after input) and, depending on interpretation as a time limit on user review/correction, 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable (A). 

Level of risk: Medium 

Spec evidence (exact): “After 1400ms, the “send” control performs a bulge animation (300ms).”“After the bulge animation ends, the preset auto-sends without further user action.” 

Theme code: CE 

CE-01 

Risk ID: CE-01 

Behaviour implied by spec: Interactivity of highlighted phrases is conveyed via visual highlight background (rgba(248, 113, 113, 0.2)) and “clickable text”. 

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): If “clickable” state is conveyed primarily by color/highlight styling (without a non-color cue or clear affordance), some users may not perceive which text is actionable. Risk includes 1.4.1 Use of Color (A); and if the purpose of activating the text is not clear from context, 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) (A). 

Level of risk: Medium 

Spec evidence (exact): “Highlight background: rgba(248, 113, 113, 0.2).”“Highlighted phrases/blocks … (clickable text …)” 

CE-02 

Risk ID: CE-02 

Behaviour implied by spec: Enter sends message; Shift+Enter is rejected (input field does not change). The input is described as multi-line elsewhere. 

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): If the control behaves inconsistently with user expectations for a multi-line input (and offers no clear instruction/feedback), users may be confused and unable to enter content as intended. This can create label/instruction and predictability risks including 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (A) and 3.2.2 On Input (A) (if “send on Enter” causes unexpected submission). 

Level of risk: Medium 

Spec evidence (exact): “Message input (multi-line)”“WHEN the user presses Enter in the message input, THEN the message is sent WITHIN immediate.”“WHEN the user presses Shift+Enter in the message input, input is rejected and the input field does not change” 

CE-03 

Risk ID: CE-03 

Behaviour implied by spec: Page language is not specified. 

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): If implemented without a programmatic language setting, screen readers may use the wrong pronunciation rules. Risk includes 3.1.1 Language of Page (A). 

Level of risk: Medium 

Spec evidence (exact): vague in the spec 

CE-04 

Risk ID: CE-04 

Behaviour implied by spec: The UI rejects user input actions (custom typing rejected; Shift+Enter rejected) and "does not change", with no user-visible feedback or assistive technology announcement specified for these rejections. 

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): If users make an input attempt and nothing changes, and no error or feedback is provided visually, users may not know an error occurred or what to do instead. Separately, if no status message or ARIA live-region announcement is provided, assistive technology users receive no programmatic indication that their action failed or that the input is intentionally non-editable. Risks include 3.3.1 Error Identification (A), 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (A), and 4.1.3 Status Messages (AA). 

Level of risk: Medium 

Spec evidence (exact): "WHEN the user presses Shift+Enter in the message input, input is rejected and the input field does not change" 
"WHEN the user tries to type a custom message input, THEN the input box does not accept this custom input to be typed in, WITHIN immediate." 
Vague in the spec: no error/feedback message or AT announcement is specified for rejected typing or Shift+Enter rejection.
