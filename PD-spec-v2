1.	Interaction Overview

This is a single-page, two-column chatbot simulation about keeping patient data anonymous when using GenAI tools. The user can “copy” specific Patient Data fields into a prompt box (only accepts patient data via copy buttons, no custom text entry), then press Send to submit that prompt as a user chat message. Depending on whether the simulation decides the prompt is missing required medical fields, the bot either types an error message or types a full referral message.

After a successful referral response, a feedback modal appears. The feedback is “✅ Excellent work!” if none of the following were included in the sent prompt: Name, Age, 
Address, Nationality, Ethnicity; otherwise it is “❌ Not quite right”. The user can then Retry (full reset) or Finish (close modal and show an alert message).

2.	Screen Map and Layout

Regions and scroll areas
Viewport-height app: total height 100vh, vertical stack.
Header: fixed height by content; does not shrink.
Main area: fills remaining height; split into 2 columns (50% / 50%); overflow-hidden overall.
Responsive reflow: at narrow viewport widths, the 2 columns stack vertically (chat / GenAI bot pane above; Patient Data pane below). In this stacked layout, both panes remain vertically scrollable.
Left column: chat messages list scrolls vertically.
Right column: Patient Data list scrolls vertically.

Major components and where they appear
Header: page heading text plus a button to reset the interaction
Left column: chat transcript area + a prompt box area containing a prompt which can be edited only by copying preset patient data fields (no custom text entry) and a Send control.
Right column: a list of Patient Data rows, each with a copy/remove button used to add/remove that field from the prompt. From left to right, each row is arranged: Copy/Remove button, Row label, Row data

4.	States

Initial state
Chat shows “How can I help?”
Prompt box shows the base referral request text
No Patient Data rows selected
Send disabled
Field-selection “lock” state (600ms window)
On activating a Patient Data copy/remove button: clicked row becomes visually highlighted and copy/remove buttons become temporarily non-interactive.
After 600ms: add/remove completes; highlight removed; prompt box rebuilt.
Field selected / field unselected
Selected fields appear as appended “Label: Value” lines in the prompt (after the 600ms selection completes).
If no fields selected: prompt shows only the base prompt (after the 600ms selection completes).
Send enabled / Send disabled
Enabled when at least 1 field is selected and a successful send has not happened yet (and visually “glowing”).
Disabled at initial load and after various reset paths.
Sending animation state (successful-send path)
Send button plays a “bulge” animation.
Thinking indicator visible / hidden
Shown in both error and success flows immediately after Send is clicked (with different follow-up timings).
Bot typing state
Bot types either the error message or the referral message (typed over a computed duration).
Feedback modal visible / hidden
Appears after successful referral, then can be dismissed via Finish or reset via Retry.
Feedback result: success / failure
Success vs failure determined by whether Name, Age, Address, Nationality, Ethnicity were included in the sent prompt.
Post-success locked state
After successful send: prompt box is blank and stays blank until Retry; selected fields remain locked; Send stays disabled.

WHEN the page loads, THEN Patient Data rows show unselected state and Send is disabled, WITHIN immediate
WHEN the user clicks the reset interaction button, the interaction reverts back to its initial state, WITHIN immediate
WHEN the user activates a Patient Data copy/remove button (and the app is not already in the middle of a field-selection animation, and a successful send has not happened yet), THEN that row becomes visually highlighted and the copy/remove buttons become temporarily non-interactive, WITHIN immediate.
WHEN a Patient Data copy/remove button was activated, THEN the add/remove action completes (icon + colour change for that row’s copy/remove button, highlight removed), and the prompt box is rebuilt to reflect the selected fields, WITHIN 600ms.
WHEN a Patient Data row is selected, THEN the prompt box includes that field as a new line in the format Label: Value (with a blank line separating the base prompt from the field list), WITHIN immediate after the 600ms selection completes.
WHEN all selected fields are removed (so none are selected), THEN the prompt box reverts to showing only the base prompt, WITHIN immediate after the 600ms selection completes.
WHEN at least 1 field is selected and a successful send has not happened yet, THEN Send becomes enabled (and visually “glowing”), WITHIN immediate.
WHEN Send is enabled and clicked, and required medical fields are missing, THEN the current prompt is posted into the chat as a user message, and a bot “thinking” indicator appears, WITHIN immediate.
WHEN a bot “thinking” indicator first appears (in either error or success flow), THEN assistive technology announces: “GenAI is writing its response”, WITHIN immediate.
WHEN the bot finishes typing and the full bot message appears (error message or referral), THEN assistive technology announces: “GenAI response complete.”, WITHIN immediate.
WHEN Send is enabled and clicked, and required medical fields are missing, THEN the bot starts typing the error message after a pause, WITHIN 800ms.
WHEN the error message typing finishes, THEN the full error message appears as a bot message, THEN the field selections are cleared, THEN the prompt resets to the base prompt, THEN Send returns to disabled, WITHIN the computed typing time.
WHEN Send is enabled and clicked, and all required medical fields are present, THEN the Send button plays a bulge animation, WITHIN immediate.
WHEN Send is enabled and clicked, and all required medical fields are present, THEN the user prompt is posted into the chat as a user message, THEN the prompt box becomes blank, THEN a bot “thinking” indicator appears, WITHIN 700ms.
WHEN the successful-send thinking begins, THEN the bot starts typing the referral after a pause, WITHIN 2000ms after thinking begins.
WHEN referral typing finishes, THEN the full referral appears as a bot message, WITHIN the computed typing time.
WHEN the referral finishes, THEN the feedback modal appears, WITHIN 500ms after the referral finishes.
WHEN the feedback modal appears, THEN keyboard focus moves into the modal (to the modal title, or if the title is not focusable then the first focusable control in the modal), WITHIN immediate.
WHILE the feedback modal is visible, THEN focus is trapped within the modal (Tab/Shift+Tab cycles through focusable elements inside the modal only), WITHIN immediate.
WHEN the feedback modal closes (via Retry or Finish), THEN focus returns to the element that had focus immediately before the modal appeared; if that element is no longer focusable, THEN focus moves to the header reset interaction button, WITHIN immediate.
WHEN the referral is produced, THEN the feedback result is:
✅ success (“Excellent work!” / “You've protected the patient's identity”) IF none of these were included: Name, Age, Address, Nationality, Ethnicity
❌ failure (“Not quite right” / “The patient's data is at risk”) IF any of those were included
WITHIN immediate once feedback is shown.
WHEN feedback is visible, THEN clicking Retry resets the entire experience to the initial state (only the welcome chat message, no selected fields, base prompt restored, Send disabled), WITHIN immediate.
WHEN feedback is visible, THEN clicking Finish closes the modal and shows the alert text “Great job! Continue to the next section of the module.”, WITHIN immediate.
WHEN any chat message is added OR the thinking/typing indicator updates, THEN the chat does not automatically scroll (no auto-scroll); the scroll position remains unchanged, WITHIN immediate.
WHEN the user attempts manual typing (including Enter or Shift+Enter) in the prompt box, THEN nothing is entered and no message is sent (the prompt box allows focus and text selection/copy, but only accepts patient data via copy buttons; no custom text entry), WITHIN immediate.
WHEN considering attachment behaviour, THEN none (no attachment UI or states). WITHIN immediate.
WHEN considering preset prompt clicks, THEN none (no preset chips; selecting Patient Data fields is the only way to change the prompt). WITHIN immediate.
Typing duration rule (for error message and referral message)
Reduced motion exception: if reduced motion preference is enabled, the typing duration rule is not applied (the full bot message appears immediately).
Total typing duration = (number of whitespace-split segments ÷ 16) × 1000ms
Per-character interval = total typing duration ÷ number of characters

✅ Excellent work!
You've protected the patient's identity by not entering any PID into GenAI. Scroll down to the next section of the module when you’re ready.
❌ Not quite right
The patient's data is at risk because you’ve entered PID into GenAI. Click retry when you’re ready to have another go, glance back at the guidance above on what counts as PID if you need help.
Alert text shown after Finish
Great job! Continue to the next section of the module.
7.	Animations and Transitions (exact)
Reduced motion preference (global)
IF the user has a system/browser preference for reduced motion, THEN:
•	All animations listed in this section do not play (including infinite pulsing/glow, entrance motion, highlight sweeps, and bulge).
•	The thinking indicator is shown without pulsing/animation.
•	Bot messages do not reveal per-character; the full message appears immediately (no typing animation).
Infinite animation stop rule: any animation marked “infinite” only runs while its trigger condition remains true, and stops immediately when the trigger condition is no longer true (e.g., Send button glow stops when Send is disabled; thinking dots pulse stops when the thinking indicator is hidden).

Highlight band definition: horizontal gradient at 90deg: transparent 0%, primary color at 0.3 opacity at 50%, transparent 100%; background size 200% 100%
Patient Data row visual transition
Element: Patient Data row (border/background/shadow and the value text styling when entering/leaving highlighted state)
Trigger: highlight on click; highlight removed after 600ms

Duration / easing: 2s, ease-in-out, infinite
Keyframes:
0% and 100%: box-shadow 0 0 0 0 using primary color at 0.4 opacity
50%: box-shadow 0 0 0 8px using primary color at 0 opacity
Send button bulge (on send)
Element: Send control
Trigger: clicking Send in the successful-send path
Duration / easing: 0.7s, ease-in-out
Keyframes: scale 1 → 1.3 → 1
Thinking dots pulse
Element: thinking indicator dots
Trigger: while the thinking indicator is visible
Duration / easing: 1s, ease-in-out, infinite

8.	Complete User Journeys
Did not include all medical information journey
Starting state: chat shows “How can I help?”, prompt shows the base prompt, Send disabled.
User does not click all of the necessary medical fields (HISTORY, MEDICATION, ALLERGIES, INVESTIGATIONS)
Each row highlights once activated, and corresponding copy/remove button becomes temporarily non-interactive, WITHIN immediate.
Selection completes and prompt builds (in order of clicks. If user clicks medication, then allergies, then history, the relevant prompt text is filled in in the same order), WITHIN 600ms.
Send becomes enabled (and visually “glowing”), WITHIN immediate.
User clicks Send. Send button bulges, WITHIN immediate.
User message posts, prompt box becomes blank, and a “thinking” indicator appears, WITHIN 700ms.
Bot types out “Oops! You've asked me to write a referral but you haven't included all of the medical information I need. Please add the missing medical fields using the Copy controls, then send again.” response
WHEN typing finishes, previously selected patient data fields remain selected; user prompt remains populated with selected fields plus base prompt; Send remains enabled when at least 1 field is selected.
System indicates which required medical fields are still missing. User may adjust selections and re-send.
Included medical information and success journey
Starting state: chat shows “How can I help?”, prompt shows the base prompt, Send disabled.
User clicks all of the necessary medical fields (HISTORY, MEDICATION, ALLERGIES, INVESTIGATIONS), but none of the patient data fields (NAME, AGE, ADDRESS, NATIONALITY, ETHNICITY)
Each row highlights once activated, and corresponding copy/remove button becomes temporarily non-interactive, WITHIN immediate.
Selection completes and prompt builds (in order of clicks. If user clicks medication, then allergies, then history, the relevant prompt text is filled in in the same order), WITHIN 600ms.
Send becomes enabled (and visually “glowing”), WITHIN immediate.
User clicks Send. Send button bulges, WITHIN immediate.
User message posts, prompt box becomes blank, and a “thinking” indicator appears, WITHIN 700ms.
Bot starts typing the referral, WITHIN 2000ms after thinking begins; typing time uses the defined typing duration rule.
Positive / success feedback modal appears, WITHIN 500ms after the referral finishes.
User clicks Retry (full reset) or Finish (close modal and show alert), WITHIN immediate.
Included medical information and failure journey
Starting state: chat shows “How can I help?”, prompt shows the base prompt, Send disabled.
User clicks all of the necessary medical fields (HISTORY, MEDICATION, ALLERGIES, INVESTIGATIONS), but includes one or more of the patient data fields (NAME, AGE, ADDRESS, NATIONALITY, ETHNICITY)
Each row highlights once activated, and corresponding copy/remove button becomes temporarily non-interactive, WITHIN immediate.
Selection completes and prompt builds (in order of clicks. If user clicks medication, then allergies, then history, the relevant prompt text is filled in in the same order), WITHIN 600ms.
Send becomes enabled (and visually “glowing”), WITHIN immediate.
User clicks Send. Send button bulges, WITHIN immediate.
User message posts, prompt box becomes blank, and a “thinking” indicator appears, WITHIN 700ms.
Bot starts typing the referral, WITHIN 2000ms after thinking begins; typing time uses the defined typing duration rule.
Negative / failure feedback modal appears, WITHIN 500ms after the referral finishes.
User clicks Retry (full reset) or Finish (close modal and show alert), WITHIN immediate.
9.	Edge Cases
Rapid clicking multiple Patient Data copy/remove buttons: during the 600ms selection window, copy/remove buttons are non-interactive, so additional clicks have no effect until it completes.
If the user repeatedly hits Send without including all required medical fields, the chat will accumulate multiple failed attempts (each adds a new user message + error response), while previously selected fields persist unless the user changes them.
After a successful send, the prompt box is blank and stays blank until Retry; selected fields remain locked (cannot be changed), and Send stays disabled.
Finish always allows progress (shows the same alert) even when the feedback state is failure.



10.	Accessibility requirements (normative)

Document and language
• The root HTML element MUST set `lang="en"`. (CE-09)
• The page `<title>` MUST be: “HITL – Keeping personal data anonymous”. (CE-05)

Landmarks, structure, and reading order
• The page MUST expose landmarks in this order in the DOM: skip link target region, header/banner, main, chat section, patient data section. Visual CSS re-ordering MUST NOT change reading/tab order. (KFP-15, CE-07, SRA-05, SRA-16)
• A visible-on-focus skip link MUST be the first focusable element and move focus to the start of main interaction content. (KFP-09)
• Header text “Keeping personal data anonymous” MUST be the page H1. (SRA-07)
• Chat transcript MUST be a programmatic list/log of messages; each message MUST include an exposed sender label (“User” or “Assistant”) that is available to assistive technology. (SRA-01, SRA-12)
• Referral output content headings (Patient details, Reason for referral, etc.) MUST be marked up as semantic headings with list content as real lists. (SRA-10)

Interactive controls and target size
• All interactive controls (Reset, info trigger, Copy/Remove controls, Send, Retry, Finish) MUST use native `<button>` elements or equivalent semantics with role, keyboard operation, and disabled-state support. (KFP-03, KFP-04, SRA-03, SRA-04)
• Activation for all buttons MUST support keyboard Enter and Space in addition to pointer/touch. (KFP-03, KFP-04)
• Minimum pointer target size for all controls MUST be at least 24x24 CSS px; if any visible glyph is smaller, add internal padding to meet this minimum. (KFP-10)
• Copy/Remove selected state MUST use at least one non-colour visual cue in addition to colour (for example icon shape change plus explicit text state). (CE-10)
• Each Patient Data toggle MUST expose selected/not-selected state programmatically (for example a toggle button with `aria-pressed="true"/"false"`, or an equivalent role/state pattern that communicates the same binary state to assistive technology). (SRA-03, SRA-04)
• For each Patient Data toggle, the visible text, accessible name, and programmatic state MUST stay synchronized after every toggle action and after reset/retry/error flows so assistive technology and visual UI always report the same state. (CE-02, SRA-03, SRA-04)
• Patient Data label source text MUST be authored in normal word case (e.g., “Name”), with uppercase appearance applied via styling only; do not hardcode all-caps letters in source content. (CE-04)

Focus visibility and focus management
• All keyboard-focusable controls MUST have a visible focus indicator with 3:1 minimum contrast against adjacent colours; use the Ring colour token for default focus outline unless overridden by equivalent-contrast styling. (KFP-05)
• Focus MUST never be hidden by overlays; when modal is open, focus MUST remain within modal controls/content until closed. (KFP-01, KFP-05)
• On modal open, focus MUST move to the modal title (or first focusable control). On close, focus MUST return to the control that opened the modal, unless removed, in which case focus goes to the nearest logical next control in main flow. (KFP-01, KFP-06, KFP-11)
• Reset action MUST place focus on the primary heading or first main interactive control after reset. (KFP-13)

Modal, tooltip, status messages, and live regions
• Feedback modal MUST use `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, and programmatic name/description linked to visible title/body text. Escape key MUST close only if an equivalent visible close path exists (Retry/Finish remain required). (KFP-01, SRA-04)
• Tooltip trigger accessible name MUST describe its purpose (for example “About this exercise”). Tooltip content MUST be associated via `aria-describedby`; tooltip MUST be dismissible and keyboard reachable without trapping focus. (KFP-14, SRA-11)
• Thinking indicator MUST expose an accessible status text (for example “Assistant is generating a response”). Decorative dots MUST be hidden from assistive tech. (SRA-02, SRA-14)
• Typing updates and completion events MUST be announced via polite live region; final error/success/system notices that require awareness MUST use `role="status"` or `role="alert"` as appropriate. (SRA-02, SRA-13, SRA-15, SRA-17, KFP-06)
• Finish confirmation text MUST be rendered as in-page status message (`role="status"` or `role="alert"`), not browser `window.alert()`. After it appears, focus MUST move to that message or next logical section link. (KFP-06, SRA-17)

Prompt box semantics and instructions
• Prompt box MUST have a persistent visible label (for example “Prompt to send”) programmatically associated to the control. Placeholder text is optional and MUST NOT be the only label. (CE-06, SRA-06)
• Prompt box is read-only for manual typing. If implemented with textarea/input semantics, it MUST expose read-only state programmatically. (SRA-06)
• Helper/instruction text MUST not rely on “click” wording alone; it MUST reference keyboard and touch activation equivalently. (CE-03, SRA-09)

Selection lock, disabled states, and order
• During the 600ms lock window, Copy/Remove controls MUST expose disabled state programmatically (`disabled` or `aria-disabled="true"`) and visually. Attempts to activate disabled controls MUST provide no state change. (KFP-07)
• Visual layering (z-index) MUST NOT determine reading order; DOM order controls sequential navigation order. Tooltip and modal containers may be portaled visually but keyboard order must remain logical. (KFP-08)

Error handling and redundant entry
• On failed send (missing required medical fields), previously selected fields MUST remain selected by default; the system MUST indicate which required medical fields are still missing. Users MUST NOT be forced to re-enter unchanged selections. (CE-01, CE-02, CE-11)
• Failed-send error suggestion text MUST be actionable and consistent with read-only prompt behaviour: instruct users to use Copy/Remove controls to add required fields. (CE-08)

Motion, timing, zoom/reflow, and obscuration
• Auto-scroll behaviour in chat MUST pause when user focus is inside older transcript content; provide a “Jump to latest” control to resume. (MTI-06)
• Any animation lasting more than 5 seconds (including infinite pulses) MUST be pausable or suppressible with an in-UI control in addition to honoring reduced-motion preference. (MTI-01, MTI-02, MTI-05)
• Non-essential motion (chat entrances, sweeps, bulges, modal entrance) MUST be disabled when reduced-motion is requested; this already applies and remains required. (MTI-03, MTI-04)
• Content MUST remain usable at 200% zoom and at 320 CSS px width without loss of information or functionality; horizontal scrolling should be avoided except where medically necessary data tokens cannot wrap. (LRZ-01, LRZ-04, LRZ-05, LRZ-08, LRZ-09)
• Main container MUST allow page-level vertical scroll when required (do not clip critical content with global overflow hidden). Nested scroll regions are allowed only where focus order and reading order remain clear. (LRZ-02)
• Prompt box with max-height MUST support internal scroll, keyboard scrolling, and visible indication that additional content exists when overflowed. (LRZ-03)
• Text must remain readable under text-resize and custom spacing: no clipping/overlap at 200% text size and with line-height 1.5, paragraph spacing 2x font size, letter spacing 0.12em, word spacing 0.16em. (LRZ-06, LRZ-07)

Colour and non-text contrast
• Icons and state indicators (including Send, Copy/Remove, modal actions, thinking/status glyphs) MUST meet 3:1 non-text contrast against adjacent backgrounds in all states, including disabled and focus styles. (SRA-08)

Input alternatives
• Functionality MUST NOT depend on drag/gesture path; all interactions are single-point activation compatible. (KFP-12)
