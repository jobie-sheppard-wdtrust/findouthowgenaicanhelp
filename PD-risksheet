WCAG 2.2 A/AA Likely-Failures Risk Sheet — Spec v1 (Combined)													
													
KFP — Keyboard, Focus, and Pointer Interactions													
													
Theme	Risk ID	Behaviour implied by spec	Why this might fail WCAG (SC)	Level of risk	Spec evidence (exact)								
KFP	KFP-01	The feedback modal appears automatically after the referral finishes. The spec does not state that focus is moved to the modal when it opens, nor that focus is trapped within the modal, nor that focus returns to a sensible element on close.	2.4.3 Focus Order (A): Without focus moving into the modal, keyboard users may continue tabbing behind the overlay and interact with obscured controls in the wrong order. 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap (A): If focus IS moved into the modal but there is no trap, focus may escape behind the overlay; conversely, if a trap is implemented without an exit mechanism, users may be trapped. 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (A): Without role="dialog" and aria-modal="true", assistive technologies won't know a modal is present.	High	"WHEN the referral finishes, THEN the feedback modal appears, WITHIN 500ms after the referral finishes." and "Feedback modal controls: 'Retry' and 'Finish'." — vague in the spec: no mention of focus management, focus trapping, dialog role, or focus restoration on close.								
KFP	KFP-03	Patient Data toggle interaction is described only as "clicks" throughout the spec. There is no mention of keyboard activation (Enter/Space) for the toggle controls.	2.1.1 Keyboard (A): All functionality must be operable via keyboard. If toggles are built as <div> or non-native elements and only respond to click/pointer events, keyboard users cannot operate them. 2.5.3 Label in Name (A): The spec provides accessible label pairs ("Copy Name"/"Remove Name") but does not specify the role (e.g., button, switch), so a developer may omit keyboard handling entirely.	High	"WHEN the user clicks a Patient Data toggle" and "On clicking a Patient Data toggle: clicked row becomes visually highlighted and the toggles become temporarily non-interactive." — vague in the spec: only "click" is mentioned; no keyboard activation specified.								
KFP	KFP-04	The Send control is described as "icon-only" with an accessible label "Send message". There is no stated HTML element, role, or requirement that it be keyboard-focusable and activatable.	2.1.1 Keyboard (A): If implemented as a non-native element (e.g., <div>) without tabindex and key handlers, it won't be keyboard operable. 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (A): Without a button role, assistive technologies won't expose it correctly.	Medium	"Send control (icon-only). Accessible label text: 'Send message'." — vague in the spec: no element type, role, or keyboard interaction specified.								
KFP	KFP-05	The spec does not describe any visible focus indicator for any interactive element (info icon, toggles, Send button, Retry, Finish). It specifies a "Ring" colour but does not mandate its application.	2.4.7 Focus Visible (AA): All keyboard-operable elements must have a visible focus indicator. A developer following only this spec could omit focus styles entirely. 2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum) (AA): When the modal overlay is shown, underlying focused elements could be obscured if focus is not managed.	High	Vague in the spec: no mention of focus indicators, :focus-visible styles, or focus ring application on any interactive element. The spec lists "Ring: 221 83% 53% (hex #2463eb)" as a colour but does not state where or how it is applied.								
KFP	KFP-06	The "Finish" action closes the modal and "shows the alert text". The spec does not state how this alert is presented — if it is a native window.alert(), focus is handled; if it is an inline element, focus may be left on the now-hidden modal or lost entirely.	2.4.3 Focus Order (A): If focus is not moved to the alert text or a logical next element after the modal closes, keyboard users are stranded. 4.1.3 Status Messages (AA): If the alert is presented as inline text without an appropriate ARIA live region or role="alert", screen readers won't announce it.	Medium	"WHEN feedback is visible, THEN clicking Finish closes the modal and shows the alert text 'Great job! Continue to the next section of the module.', WITHIN immediate." — vague in the spec: mechanism of alert presentation, focus destination, and ARIA role not specified.								
KFP	KFP-07	During the 600ms toggle lock state, "toggles become temporarily non-interactive." The spec does not state whether the disabled state is communicated programmatically (e.g., aria-disabled, disabled attribute) or only visually.	4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (A): If the temporarily non-interactive state is only visual, assistive technologies will still report the toggles as operable, and keyboard users may attempt activation with no feedback. 2.1.1 Keyboard (A): If keyboard events are suppressed without communicating state, it silently fails.	Medium	"clicked row becomes visually highlighted and the toggles become temporarily non-interactive." and "Disabled control opacity: 0.5." — vague in the spec: only visual indication of non-interactivity described; no programmatic disabled state specified.								
KFP	KFP-08	The spec specifies tooltip z-index of 20 and modal overlay z-index of 50, but does not address tab order or DOM order of these elements relative to the main content.	2.4.3 Focus Order (A): If the tooltip or modal content is placed at the end of the DOM but visually positioned near its trigger, the tab order won't match visual order, confusing keyboard users.	Low	"Z-order: tooltip content layer value 20; feedback overlay above everything (layer value 50)." — vague in the spec: DOM/tab order not specified.								
KFP	KFP-09	The spec describes no skip/bypass mechanism for the page. The header, tooltip, patient data panel (9 toggle controls), prompt box, and send button all precede or surround the chat area. A keyboard user must tab through all of these to reach different sections.	2.4.1 Bypass Blocks (A): A mechanism must be available to bypass blocks of content repeated or grouped on the page. The patient data toggles (9 items), header controls, and prompt area form significant blocks with no described skip link or landmark-based bypass.	Medium	Vague in the spec: no skip links, bypass mechanisms, or navigation shortcuts described. The layout is "Header… Left column: chat transcript area + a prompt box area… Right column: a list of Patient Data rows" with no stated bypass.								
KFP	KFP-10	The Send control and Patient Data toggles have no specified minimum target size. The Send is described as "icon-only" with styling details (radius 0.75rem) but no width/height. Toggle controls have no dimensions stated.	2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum) (AA): Pointer input targets must be at least 24×24 CSS pixels, unless an equivalent control exists or spacing exceptions apply. An icon-only send button and small toggle icons could easily be under 24×24px with no dimensions specified.	Medium	"Send control (icon-only). Accessible label text: 'Send message'." and "send button radius 0.75rem" — vague in the spec: no width, height, or minimum target size specified for any interactive control.								
KFP	KFP-11	After a successful send, "selected fields remain locked (cannot be changed), and Send stays disabled." The spec does not describe how this locked state is communicated to keyboard or AT users beyond the visual disabled opacity.	4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (A): The post-success locked state applies to all 9 toggle controls simultaneously. If the locked/disabled state is only communicated via "Disabled control opacity: 0.5" and not programmatically (e.g., aria-disabled="true"), AT users will not know the controls are locked. 2.1.1 Keyboard (A): If keyboard events are silently swallowed with no state feedback, keyboard users receive no indication the controls are inoperable.	Medium	"After successful send: prompt box is blank and stays blank until Retry; selected fields remain locked; Send stays disabled." and "Disabled control opacity: 0.5." — vague in the spec: post-success locked state only described visually.								
KFP	KFP-12	The spec describes toggle activation as "On clicking a Patient Data toggle" and the 600ms lock fires immediately. It does not specify whether the action triggers on the down-event (mousedown/pointerdown) or the up-event (click/pointerup). If the action fires on the down-event, users cannot abort by moving the pointer away before releasing.	2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation (A): For single-pointer functionality, the down-event must not execute the function, or completion must occur on the up-event with an abort/undo mechanism. The spec does not clarify the event type, and the immediate 600ms lock with no described undo mechanism compounds the risk.	Low	"WHEN the user clicks a Patient Data toggle (and the app is not already in the middle of a field-toggle animation, and a successful send has not happened yet), THEN that row becomes visually highlighted and the toggles become temporarily non-interactive, WITHIN immediate." — vague in the spec: "clicks" does not specify down-event vs up-event activation; no abort or undo mechanism described.								
KFP	KFP-13	A “Reset” control returns the whole interaction to the initial state, but the spec does not state that the control is keyboard-operable/focusable, nor what happens to focus when the UI is reset (e.g., whether focus is moved to a stable element after the DOM/content changes).	2.1.1 Keyboard (A): if the reset control is implemented in a pointer-only way, keyboard users may not be able to reset. 2.4.3 Focus Order (A): resetting content can remove the currently focused element; without a specified focus destination, focus may be lost or land unpredictably. 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (A): if the reset control isn’t implemented as a proper control (e.g., button semantics), assistive tech may not expose it correctly.	Medium	“Reset icon. Accessible label text: “Reset this game to the beginning”.” and “WHEN the user clicks the reset interaction button, the interaction reverts back to its initial state, WITHIN immediate”								
KFP	KFP-14	A tooltip exists (additional content associated with an icon/trigger), but the spec does not state how it behaves on hover/focus: whether it can be dismissed without moving pointer/focus, whether it stays visible long enough to interact with/read, or whether it remains visible when the pointer moves over it.	1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus (AA): tooltip-style content can fail if it is not dismissible, not hoverable, or not persistent until dismissed/invalid. 2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum) (AA): if the tooltip appears above other UI at higher zoom and cannot be dismissed, it may obscure currently focused content.	Medium	“Tooltip text: “Learn to protect patient data when using GenAI tools. Only share medical details needed for care.”” and “Tooltip content width: 220px; offset below icon: 100% + 8px; border radius: 0.5rem; padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem; font size: 0.875rem.” and “Z-order: tooltip content layer value 20; feedback overlay above everything (layer value 50).”								
KFP	KFP-15	Keyboard tab/focus order between the two side-by-side columns (chat/prompt/send vs Patient Data list) is not specified.	2.4.3 Focus Order (A): a developer could implement a tab/focus sequence that jumps between regions in an order that is not meaningful (e.g., entering the Patient Data list before the prompt/send area, or an unexpected interleaving across the two scroll regions).	Medium	“Main area: fills remaining height; split into 2 columns (50% / 50%); overflow-hidden overall.” + “Left column: chat transcript area + a prompt box area containing a prompt which can be edited only by copying preset patient data fields (no custom text entry) and a Send control.” + “Right column: a list of Patient Data rows, each with a toggle control used to add/remove that field from the prompt.”								
													
SRA — Screen Reader Semantics and Announcements													
													
Theme	Risk ID	Behaviour implied by spec	Why this might fail WCAG (SC)	Level of risk	Spec evidence (exact)								
SRA	SRA-01	The chat transcript area has no specified semantic structure. Messages appear as bot or user bubbles with a typing effect, but no roles (e.g., log, list), landmarks, or ARIA live regions are defined. The thinking indicator and typed messages appear dynamically.	4.1.3 Status Messages (AA): Dynamically added chat messages (bot responses, error messages) are status updates that must be announced to screen readers without receiving focus. Without role="log", aria-live, or similar, screen reader users will have no awareness of new messages. 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A): Without semantic structure (e.g., a list or role="log"), the relationship between messages and their sequence is not programmatically determinable.	High	"Chat transcript area, containing bot/user messages plus a bot 'thinking' indicator and a typing effect." and "WHEN any chat message is added OR the thinking/typing indicator updates, THEN the chat automatically scrolls to the bottom" — vague in the spec: no ARIA live region, log role, or announcement mechanism specified for any dynamic chat content.								
SRA	SRA-02	The bot "thinking" indicator (three pulsing dots) and the character-by-character typing effect are purely visual. The spec does not describe any screen reader announcement for these states.	4.1.3 Status Messages (AA): The thinking state and progressive typing are meaningful status changes. Without announcements, screen reader users won't know the bot is processing or responding. Additionally, character-by-character typing with a live region could create an overwhelming stream of announcements if aria-live is set to "assertive" on the typing container.	High	"Shown in both error and success flows immediately after Send is clicked" and "Bot types either the error message or the referral message (typed over a computed duration)." — vague in the spec: no screen reader announcement strategy for thinking or typing states.								
SRA	SRA-03	The Patient Data toggle controls have accessible label pairs ("Copy Name"/"Remove Name"), but the spec does not define the widget role (button, switch, checkbox) or the toggled/pressed state attribute.	4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (A): Without a defined role and state (e.g., aria-pressed, aria-checked, role="switch"), assistive technologies cannot convey whether a field is currently selected or not. The label swaps alone are insufficient if the role doesn't support a toggled state concept. 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A): The relationship between the toggle and the field it controls is not programmatically defined.	High	"Patient Data toggle controls (one per field). Accessible label text pairs: 'Copy Name' / 'Remove Name'" — vague in the spec: no role, state attribute, or grouping semantics specified.								
SRA	SRA-04	The feedback modal has title text and body content but no specified dialog role, aria-labelledby, or aria-describedby.	4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (A): Without role="dialog" and an accessible name, assistive technologies won't announce the modal as a dialog or convey its purpose when focus enters. 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A): The structural relationship between the modal title ("Excellent work!" / "Not quite right") and its explanatory body text is not programmatically defined.	High	"Feedback modal content (success/failure messages)." and "Modal title: font size 1.25rem, weight 700." — vague in the spec: modal semantics, dialog role, and labelling not specified.								
SRA	SRA-05	The page has a header, two columns, a chat area, a patient data panel, and a prompt area. No landmark roles or region labels are specified.	1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A): Without landmarks (<header>, <main>, <nav>, role="region" with labels, etc.), screen reader users cannot orient themselves or navigate by region. The two-column layout's purpose and relationship is only conveyed visually.	Medium	"Header: page heading text plus an info icon" and "Main area: fills remaining height; split into 2 columns (50% / 50%)" — vague in the spec: no HTML landmark elements, ARIA landmarks, or region labels specified.								
SRA	SRA-06	The prompt box is described as non-editable (no custom text entry) but shows dynamic content. Its role is unspecified — it could be a <textarea readonly>, a <div>, or other element.	4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (A): If the prompt box appears editable (e.g., styled like a text input) but is actually read-only, its role and state must communicate this. Without an accessible name and appropriate role, screen readers may announce it incorrectly or users may be confused about why typing doesn't work. 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A): The prompt box's label ("Your prompt will appear here...") is described as placeholder text, which alone is insufficient as a persistent accessible name.	Medium	"Prompt box (only accepts patient data via copy buttons, no custom text entry) showing the base prompt and any selected field lines. Placeholder text exists: 'Your prompt will appear here...'" — vague in the spec: element type, role, accessible name, and read-only state not specified.								
SRA	SRA-07	The header text is described with visual styling but no heading level is specified. The modal title is styled as large bold text but no heading level is specified.	1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A): If heading text is styled visually but not marked up with <h1>–<h6> or role="heading", screen readers won't identify them as headings, breaking document structure and navigation.	Medium	"Header text: 'Keeping personal data anonymous'" and "Modal title: font size 1.25rem, weight 700." — vague in the spec: no heading levels specified for any text.								
SRA	SRA-08	The spec uses emoji characters (✅ and ❌) in the feedback result to convey success or failure.	1.1.1 Non-text Content (A): Emoji are non-text content. If not supplemented with text alternatives or hidden from AT (since adjacent text like "Excellent work!" / "Not quite right" already conveys meaning), screen readers will announce the raw emoji Unicode names (e.g., "white heavy check mark"), which may be confusing or redundant.	Low	"✅ success ('Excellent work!'…) IF none of these were included" and "❌ failure ('Not quite right'…) IF any of those were included"								
SRA	SRA-09	The helper text "Click copy to add or remove fields from your prompt" is described as an informational component but its programmatic association to the Patient Data panel or toggles is not specified.	1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A): If this instruction text is not programmatically associated with the toggle controls (e.g., via aria-describedby or by being within the same labelled region), screen reader users may not encounter it when interacting with the toggles. 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (A): Instructions must be provided when content requires user input; if the instructions are present but not discoverable by AT users, they effectively aren't provided.	Medium	"Helper text: 'Click copy to add or remove fields from your prompt'" — vague in the spec: no programmatic association to the patient data controls specified.								
SRA	SRA-10	The referral bot message contains structured sections ("Patient details", "Reason for referral", "Relevant background", "Current management", "Allergies", "Relevant investigations", "Additional information") that function as headings within the message. The spec lists them as content but specifies no semantic markup.	1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A): These section labels visually structure a long message but if rendered as plain text within a chat bubble, the structural relationships (heading → content) are not programmatically determinable. Screen reader users cannot navigate within this long message by heading.	Medium	"Referral chatbot message (shown after a successful send)… Patient details… Reason for referral… Relevant background… Current management… Allergies… Relevant investigations… Additional information" — vague in the spec: no heading markup or structural semantics specified within the referral message.								
SRA	SRA-11	The info icon's accessible label is "Learn more" but the tooltip it reveals contains instructional text. The spec does not describe a programmatic relationship between the icon and the tooltip content (e.g., aria-describedby, aria-controls, or role="tooltip").	4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (A): Without a programmatic association, AT users may activate or focus the icon and hear "Learn more" but have no way to know the tooltip content has appeared or what it says. The tooltip's role (role="tooltip") and its relationship to the trigger are unspecified. 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A): The relationship between the info icon and the tooltip content is only conveyed visually (spatial proximity).	Medium	"Info icon control (shows tooltip on hover/focus). Accessible label text: 'Learn more'." and "Tooltip text: 'Learn to protect patient data when using GenAI tools. Only share medical details needed for care.'" — vague in the spec: no aria-describedby, aria-controls, or role="tooltip" specified.								
SRA	SRA-12	Chat messages are visually distinguished as "bot" or "user" by bubble colour and positioning (left vs right). The spec does not specify how message authorship is programmatically conveyed.	1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A): The distinction between bot and user messages is conveyed only through visual presentation (colour + position). Without programmatic identification (e.g., a visually hidden prefix like "You:" / "Bot:", or aria-label on each message), screen reader users cannot determine who said what.	Medium	"Chat bot bubble: 220 15% 95%… Chat user bubble: 221 83% 53%" and "Chat bubble max width: 85%." — vague in the spec: message authorship distinguished only by visual styling; no programmatic author identification specified.								
SRA	SRA-13	The prompt box content changes dynamically each time a field toggle completes (after 600ms). Selected fields are appended or removed as lines of text. The spec does not describe any announcement or notification mechanism for these content changes. This is distinct from the chat transcript (SRA-01): the prompt box is a separate component whose content silently updates.	4.1.3 Status Messages (AA): The prompt box update is a status change resulting from user action — it confirms that the toggle action succeeded and shows what will be sent. Without a live region or other announcement, screen reader users have no feedback that their toggle action changed the prompt content, and must manually navigate to the prompt box to verify.	Medium	"the prompt box is rebuilt to reflect the selected fields, WITHIN 600ms." and "the prompt box includes that field as a new line in the format Label: Value" — vague in the spec: no live region, announcement, or notification mechanism specified for prompt box content changes.								
SRA	SRA-14	The thinking indicator is described as three animated dots. The spec provides no text alternative or accessible name for this indicator. It functions as non-text content conveying that the bot is processing.	1.1.1 Non-text Content (A): The thinking indicator (pulsing dots) is non-text content presented to the user that serves the purpose of communicating a processing/loading state. It requires a text alternative (e.g., "Bot is thinking…") that serves the equivalent purpose. The spec describes only the visual animation, with no text alternative or off-screen label.	Medium	"Thinking dots pulse — Element: thinking indicator dots — Trigger: while the thinking indicator is visible" and "a bot 'thinking' indicator appears" — vague in the spec: no text alternative, accessible name, or aria-label specified for the thinking indicator.								
SRA	SRA-15	Dynamic feedback panels and status messages appear after user actions, but the spec does not state that these updates are programmatically announced to assistive technologies.	4.1.3 Status Messages (AA): if feedback appears visually but is not exposed as a status message (e.g., polite/assertive live region), screen reader users may not be informed of results. 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A): if structural relationships of feedback (e.g., correct/incorrect, explanation text) are only visual, they may not be conveyed programmatically.	High	Spec describes feedback panels appearing with outcome text, but is vague in the spec about programmatic announcement or live region behaviour.								
SRA	SRA-16	Side-by-side layout of content blocks and feedback panels is defined visually, but no requirement is stated for programmatic grouping or association between each block and its corresponding feedback.	1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A): if relationships between a specific user choice and its feedback are only implied by layout, screen reader users may not understand which feedback relates to which block.	Medium	“The intended design should be a side-by-side feedback panel layout, occupying the same dimensions as the initial side-by-side feedback panels.” — vague in the spec regarding programmatic association.								
SRA	SRA-17	After “Finish”, an alert message is shown, but no requirement says it is announced to assistive tech as a status update.	4.1.3 Status Messages (AA): if the alert is only visual (not exposed as a programmatic status message), screen reader users may not be informed that they should “Continue to the next section of the module.”	Medium	“WHEN feedback is visible, THEN clicking Finish closes the modal and shows the alert text “Great job! Continue to the next section of the module.”, WITHIN immediate.”								
													
LRZ — Layout, Reflow, Zoom, and Scrolling													
													
Theme	Risk ID	Behaviour implied by spec	Why this might fail WCAG (SC)	Level of risk	Spec evidence (exact)								
LRZ	LRZ-01	The app is locked to a 100vh viewport height with a fixed two-column (50%/50%) layout. There is no mention of responsive or single-column behaviour at narrow widths or when zoomed to 400%.	1.4.10 Reflow (AA): Content must be presentable without two-dimensional scrolling at 320 CSS pixels wide. A fixed two-column layout at 50%/50% in a 100vh container will almost certainly require horizontal scrolling or cause content to overflow/be clipped at 320px width.	High	"Viewport-height app: total height 100vh, vertical stack." and "Main area: fills remaining height; split into 2 columns (50% / 50%); overflow-hidden overall."								
LRZ	LRZ-02	The main area is set to "overflow-hidden overall", and each column scrolls independently. At high zoom levels, content within each column may be clipped by the overflow-hidden parent.	1.4.10 Reflow (AA): Content that disappears due to overflow: hidden on a non-scrollable parent at high zoom is a known failure (F102). 1.4.4 Resize Text (AA): If text is resized to 200% and the column's scroll area or the overflow-hidden parent clips it, there is loss of content.	High	"Main area: fills remaining height; split into 2 columns (50% / 50%); overflow-hidden overall."								
LRZ	LRZ-03	The prompt box has a fixed max-height of 220px. When multiple patient data fields are selected, the content may exceed this height. The spec does not state whether the prompt box scrolls internally.	1.4.4 Resize Text (AA): At 200% zoom, the prompt content within a 220px max-height container will be clipped or truncated if no scroll mechanism exists.	Medium	"Prompt box min height: 84px; max height: 220px." — vague in the spec: no overflow/scroll behaviour specified for the prompt box.								
LRZ	LRZ-04	The modal has "max width: 32rem" and the overlay has "padding: 1rem", but no responsive behaviour is described for very narrow viewports or high zoom.	1.4.10 Reflow (AA): At 320px width, a 32rem (~512px) max-width modal will overflow the viewport. With only 1rem padding on the overlay, the modal content will likely be clipped or require horizontal scrolling.	Medium	"Modal overlay padding: 1rem; modal content max width: 32rem."								
LRZ	LRZ-05	The tooltip has a fixed width of 220px and is positioned "offset below icon: 100% + 8px". At narrow viewports or when zoomed, the tooltip may overflow off-screen.	1.4.10 Reflow (AA): A fixed-width tooltip that doesn't reposition responsively can be clipped at the viewport edge at 320px width.	Low	"Tooltip content width: 220px; offset below icon: 100% + 8px"								
LRZ	LRZ-06	Patient field labels use a font size of 0.75rem (12px). The spec does not specify that this text resizes with user preferences or zoom.	1.4.4 Resize Text (AA): While rem units are relative, 0.75rem is very small. If combined with a container that has overflow-hidden or a fixed height, resizing to 200% may cause clipping. The small base size increases the risk of content loss when zoomed.	Low	"Patient field label: font size 0.75rem, uppercase, letter spacing 0.025em."								
LRZ	LRZ-07	The spec describes text spacing values (font size 0.875rem, line-height 1.625; font size 0.75rem with letter-spacing 0.025em) but does not address whether the layout tolerates user-overridden text spacing per WCAG requirements (line-height 1.5×, paragraph spacing 2×, letter-spacing 0.12×, word-spacing 0.16×). The fixed-height containers (100vh, max-height 220px prompt box) and overflow-hidden suggest content would be clipped.	1.4.12 Text Spacing (AA): No loss of content or functionality may occur when users override text spacing to the specified minimums. Fixed-height containers with overflow-hidden are the most common cause of text-spacing failures.	Medium	"Viewport-height app: total height 100vh" and "Prompt box min height: 84px; max height: 220px." and "Main area: fills remaining height; split into 2 columns (50% / 50%); overflow-hidden overall." — vague in the spec: no consideration of user text-spacing overrides; fixed-height and overflow-hidden layout constraints present.								
LRZ	LRZ-08	The spec uses a 100vh fixed height and does not mention orientation support or any responsive behaviour for portrait vs landscape.	1.3.4 Orientation (AA): Content must not restrict its view to a single display orientation unless essential. A fixed 100vh two-column layout may become unusable in portrait on narrow/short devices, and the spec provides no alternative layout or orientation handling. While not explicitly locking orientation, the rigid layout may effectively restrict usability to landscape.	Low	"Viewport-height app: total height 100vh, vertical stack." and "Main area: fills remaining height; split into 2 columns (50% / 50%)" — vague in the spec: no orientation consideration, responsive breakpoints, or alternative layout mentioned.								
LRZ	LRZ-09	Fixed pixel widths (e.g., tooltip width 220px) and layered positioning are specified, but no behaviour is defined for 320px wide viewport or 400% zoom.	1.4.10 Reflow (AA): fixed-width elements may require horizontal scrolling at small viewport widths. 1.4.4 Resize Text (AA): content may overlap or clip at 200% zoom if layout rules are not constrained.	Medium	“Tooltip content width: 220px; offset below icon: 100% + 8px; border radius: 0.5rem; padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem; font size: 0.875rem.” — vague in the spec regarding reflow behaviour at small viewports or high zoom.								
													
MTI — Motion, Timing, and Interruptions													
													
Theme	Risk ID	Behaviour implied by spec	Why this might fail WCAG (SC)	Level of risk	Spec evidence (exact)								
MTI	MTI-01	The Send button has an infinite pulsing glow animation ("2s, ease-in-out, infinite") whenever it is enabled. There is no mention of a mechanism to pause, stop, or hide this animation, nor does it respect prefers-reduced-motion.	2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide (A): Any animation that starts automatically, lasts more than 5 seconds, and is presented alongside other content must have a pause/stop/hide mechanism. The infinite glow meets all three conditions. 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold (A): While a box-shadow pulse is unlikely to exceed flash thresholds, the spec does not confirm this.	High	"Send button glow (enabled state) — Duration / easing: 2s, ease-in-out, infinite — Keyframes: 0% and 100%: box-shadow 0 0 0 0 using primary color at 0.4 opacity; 50%: box-shadow 0 0 0 8px using primary color at 0 opacity"								
MTI	MTI-02	The thinking dots have an infinite pulsing animation ("1s, ease-in-out, infinite") that runs while the indicator is visible. In the success path, thinking is visible for up to 2000ms, and during error for 800ms. In both cases, if the user sends multiple times, the indicator reappears repeatedly. No pause mechanism or prefers-reduced-motion check is mentioned.	2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide (A): The thinking dots pulse continuously while visible. In the success path the thinking indicator appears and the bot then types for a computed duration — the total animation time can easily exceed 5 seconds. There is no mechanism to pause or stop it.	Medium	"Thinking dots pulse — Duration / easing: 1s, ease-in-out, infinite — Keyframes: opacity 0.4 → 1 → 0.4 — Stagger: dot 1 delay 0s; dot 2 delay 0.2s; dot 3 delay 0.4s"								
MTI	MTI-03	The bot typing effect reveals text character-by-character over a computed duration. For the referral message (which is very long), the typing duration could be many seconds. The user cannot skip, pause, or speed up this animation. During this time, the Send button is disabled and the user must wait.	2.2.1 Timing Adjustable (A): The typing animation acts as a time limit on accessing the full content — the user must wait for it to finish before the feedback modal appears and before they can see the complete message. There is no mechanism to turn off, adjust, or extend this timing. 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide (A): The character-by-character typing is auto-updating content that the user cannot pause or stop.	High	"Total typing duration = (number of whitespace-split segments ÷ 16) × 1000ms" and "Per-character interval = total typing duration ÷ number of characters" and "WHEN referral typing finishes, THEN the full referral appears as a bot message" — vague in the spec: no skip, pause, or speed control mentioned.								
MTI	MTI-04	The feedback modal auto-appears 500ms after the referral finishes, without any user action. This is an automatic change of context (an overlay that blocks underlying content).	3.2.1 On Focus (A) / 3.2.2 On Input (A): While the modal doesn't trigger on focus or input change specifically, it triggers automatically after a system process completes. If focus moves into the modal automatically, this is a change of context not initiated by the user. 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide (A): The modal interrupts the user's ability to review the referral message — it appears automatically and overlays the chat content.	Medium	"WHEN the referral finishes, THEN the feedback modal appears, WITHIN 500ms after the referral finishes."								
MTI	MTI-05	None of the seven specified animations (chat entrance, highlight sweep, row transition, send glow, send bulge, thinking dots, modal entrance, tooltip show/hide) mention prefers-reduced-motion media query support.	2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold (A): While individual animations are unlikely to flash, the spec provides no mechanism to disable or reduce motion for users with vestibular disorders. This is an advisory concern under WCAG 2.2 AA but becomes a failure risk if any animation triggers seizures or physical reactions.	Low	Vague in the spec: no mention of prefers-reduced-motion across any of the seven animations listed in section "7) Animations and Transitions (exact)".								
MTI	MTI-06	The chat area auto-scrolls to the bottom whenever content is added or the typing indicator updates. During the character-by-character typing effect, this means continuous auto-scrolling. The user has no way to pause or stop this auto-scroll — if they scroll up to review earlier messages, the next typing update will force them back to the bottom.	2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide (A): Auto-updating content that starts automatically and is presented alongside other content must have a mechanism to pause, stop, or hide it. The auto-scroll during typing is auto-updating behaviour that the user cannot control, and it overrides the user's own scroll position.	Medium	"WHEN any chat message is added OR the thinking/typing indicator updates, THEN the chat automatically scrolls to the bottom so the newest content is visible, WITHIN immediate."								
													
CE — Content and Errors													
													
Theme	Risk ID	Behaviour implied by spec	Why this might fail WCAG (SC)	Level of risk	Spec evidence (exact)								
CE	CE-01	The error flow after a failed send (missing required medical fields) resets all field selections and the prompt automatically, with no user confirmation. The error message "Oops! You've asked me to write a referral but you haven't included all of the medical information I need" does not identify which specific fields are missing.	3.3.1 Error Identification (A): When an input error is detected, the item in error must be identified and the error described in text. The error message does not specify which medical fields are missing — it only says generically that "all of the medical information" isn't included. 3.3.3 Error Suggestion (AA): If the system knows which fields are required, suggestions for correction should be provided. The spec's error message gives no specific guidance.	High	"Oops! You've asked me to write a referral but you haven't included all of the medical information I need. Could you paste it in, and then I can write a referral for you?" and "MISSING INFO: which Patient Data fields count as 'required medical fields' for determining error vs successful referral."								
CE	CE-02	After the error message typing finishes, the user's field selections are cleared and the prompt resets automatically. The user loses all their work without confirmation.	3.3.4 Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data) (AA): While this is an educational simulation (not strictly legal/financial), the auto-reset of user-entered data on error — without offering the user the ability to review, correct, or undo — removes user control. The user must re-select all fields from scratch. If the data modification triggers this SC, there is no reversible, checked, or confirmed path.	Medium	"WHEN the error message typing finishes, THEN the full error message appears as a bot message, THEN the field selections are cleared, THEN the prompt resets to the base prompt, THEN Send returns to disabled"								
CE	CE-03	The instruction text says "Click copy to add or remove fields from your prompt." The actual interaction is a toggle control, but the instruction says "Click copy" — which implies a mouse-only action and doesn't convey that it's a toggle or that keyboard activation is possible.	3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (A): Instructions should accurately describe the required interaction. "Click copy" is ambiguous: it implies a clipboard copy action and mouse-only use, when the actual behaviour is toggling fields in/out of the prompt. This may mislead users about the expected interaction.	Medium	"Helper text: 'Click copy to add or remove fields from your prompt'"								
CE	CE-04	The Patient Data labels are displayed "visually in ALL CAPS in the list (due to styling)" using CSS uppercase. The spec implies these are styled as uppercase rather than authored as uppercase.	1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A): If the uppercase is achieved via CSS text-transform: uppercase, the source text remains mixed case, which is correct. However, the spec also lists the labels in actual uppercase ("NAME:", "AGE:", etc.) in the content section. If a developer uses literal uppercase text in the HTML, some screen readers may spell out each letter (e.g., "N-A-M-E") instead of reading it as a word.	Low	"Labels appear visually in ALL CAPS in the list (due to styling): NAME: AGE: ADDRESS:..."								
CE	CE-05	The page title is specified as "Patient Data Guardian - Single Page" but this title does not clearly describe the topic or purpose of the page to users who arrive at it.	2.4.2 Page Titled (A): The title should describe topic or purpose. "Patient Data Guardian - Single Page" is somewhat generic — "Single Page" adds no meaning. While borderline, it may not adequately describe that this is an interactive training simulation about anonymising patient data for GenAI tools.	Low	"Page title: Patient Data Guardian - Single Page"								
CE	CE-06	The spec states the prompt box has "Placeholder text exists: 'Your prompt will appear here...'" but also says "Prompt box shows the pre-filled referral request text" at load. If placeholder text is used as the only label, it disappears when content appears, leaving the prompt box unlabelled.	3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (A): Placeholder text alone is insufficient as a label because it disappears when content is present. The prompt box has pre-filled content at load, meaning the placeholder may never be visible, and no persistent label is described. 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (A): Without a persistent label, the programmatic name of the prompt box is unclear.	Medium	"Prompt box (only accepts patient data via copy buttons, no custom text entry) showing the base prompt and any selected field lines. Placeholder text exists: 'Your prompt will appear here...'"								
CE	CE-07	The spec describes a two-column layout with the chat on the left and Patient Data on the right, but no reading order or meaningful sequence is specified. The spec says "overflow-hidden overall" on the main area.	1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence (A): The correct reading sequence (instruction → patient data selection → prompt building → send → chat response) must be programmatically determinable. With a two-column CSS layout, the DOM order may not match the intended interaction flow, and the spec does not specify DOM order.	Medium	"Main area: fills remaining height; split into 2 columns (50% / 50%); overflow-hidden overall." and "Left column: chat transcript area + a prompt box area… Right column: a list of Patient Data rows" — vague in the spec: DOM order / reading sequence not specified.								
CE	CE-08	The error message says "Could you paste it in" — but the prompt box does not accept custom text entry or pasting. This instruction is misleading.	3.3.3 Error Suggestion (AA): Error suggestions must be actionable. Telling the user to "paste it in" when pasting is disabled provides an incorrect suggestion for correction, potentially causing confusion rather than helping the user fix the error.	Medium	"Oops! You've asked me to write a referral but you haven't included all of the medical information I need. Could you paste it in, and then I can write a referral for you?" combined with "the prompt box only accepts patient data via copy buttons, no custom text entry" and "WHEN the user attempts manual typing (including Enter or Shift+Enter) in the prompt box, THEN nothing is entered"								
CE	CE-09	The spec provides a "Page title" but does not specify a lang attribute for the HTML document.	3.1.1 Language of Page (A): The default human language of the page must be programmatically determinable. The spec does not mention a lang attribute on the HTML element. A developer following only this spec may omit it.	Medium	Vague in the spec: no lang attribute or language declaration mentioned anywhere.								
CE	CE-10	The toggle states are distinguished by "icon + colour change" only. The spec describes no secondary visual indicator (shape, border, text change) beyond colour to differentiate selected from unselected states.	1.4.1 Use of Color (A): Colour must not be the only visual means of conveying information. If selected vs. unselected toggle states are distinguished solely by a colour change on the icon (plus the label swap which may not be visually prominent), users who cannot perceive colour differences cannot determine field selection state.	Medium	"the add/remove action completes (icon + colour change for that row's toggle, highlight removed)" — vague in the spec: no non-colour visual indicator (shape change, border, checkmark) described beyond "icon + colour change".								
CE	CE-11	The error flow resets all selections and forces the user to re-select fields from scratch. Previously entered information is not retained or offered for re-selection.	3.3.7 Redundant Entry (A): Information previously entered by the user that is required to be entered again in the same process must be auto-populated or available for the user to select. The user's field selections are wiped on error, forcing them to re-do all toggle selections without any memory of what was previously chosen.	Medium	"WHEN the error message typing finishes, THEN the full error message appears as a bot message, THEN the field selections are cleared, THEN the prompt resets to the base prompt, THEN Send returns to disabled."
