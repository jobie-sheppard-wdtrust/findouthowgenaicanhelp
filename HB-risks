Risk list — Hallucination & Bias

This sheet has been reconciled against `HB-spec-v2` (including Section 10 Accessibility Requirements).

## Open risks (medium/serious)

Theme code: (A11Y-GAP)

R-017

Risk ID: R-017

Behaviour implied by spec: Dismissing the per-block “Feedback” modal by clicking outside the card OR pressing Escape still triggers the “Check content” processing sequence (not a neutral cancel).

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): Users may cause a significant change (insertion + correction flow) through an action commonly understood as “dismiss/cancel”, making the result unpredictable. WCAG 3.2.2 (A) On Input.

Level of risk: Medium

Spec evidence (exact):
- “WHEN the user clicks outside the modal card (on the dark overlay) OR presses Escape, THEN the block is processed as a “Check content” action (highlight → insert → correction), WITHIN immediate after dismissal.”

---

R-022

Risk ID: R-022

Behaviour implied by spec: The “Check content” correction sequence chains multiple timed operations; draft-block interactions are suppressed during animation and no explicit pause/stop/hide or skip control is required for the non-reduced-motion path.

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): Extended auto-updating visual changes without explicit user control can create failure risk for WCAG 2.2.2 (A) Pause, Stop, Hide.

Level of risk: Medium

Spec evidence (exact):
- “WHEN an animation is currently running, THEN clicking draft blocks does not open the context menu, WITHIN immediate.”
- Correction timing rules define chained delays and typing effects (1000 ms pre-highlight pause, 900 ms delete-highlight, 500 ms post-highlight pause, 650 ms post-delete pause, 80 ms/character typing, whitespace pauses, and 900 ms inter-block pauses).
- Section 10 includes reduced-motion behaviour, but no explicit pause/stop/hide or skip control requirement for standard-motion mode.

---

N-01

Risk ID: N-01

Behaviour implied by spec: Section 10 requires a “clearly visible focus indicator” but does not define measurable focus appearance minimum characteristics.

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): “Clearly visible” can be implemented inconsistently; without explicit measurable minimums, implementations may fail WCAG 2.4.13 (AA) Focus Appearance.

Level of risk: Medium

Spec evidence (exact):
- “All focusable interactive elements have a clearly visible focus indicator.”
- No explicit measurable criteria are provided for focus indicator contrast, area/thickness, or minimum appearance change.

Task to resolve by modifying spec:
- Add explicit Section 10 focus appearance minimum requirements aligned to WCAG 2.4.13 (AA), including measurable criteria for indicator contrast and indicator area/thickness.

## Resolved / false-positive risks (covered by current spec)

The following existing risks are now treated as resolved because `HB-spec-v2` Section 10 explicitly defines requirements that address them:

- R-001, R-002, R-003, R-004 (keyboard operability, menu/modal keyboard handling, focus return, hover/focus parity).
- R-005, R-006 (visible focus and focus not obscured).
- R-007, R-008, R-009, R-010, R-011, R-021 (name/role/state, programmatic regions/headings, status messages, sequence/focus order, language, draft↔feedback association).
- R-012, R-013, R-019 (reflow and text-spacing requirements at 320px / 400% and spacing resilience).
- R-014 (reduced-motion handling is explicitly required; animation-control concern retained under R-022 only).
- R-015 (use-of-colour covered by explicit non-colour cues in feedback naming requirements).
- R-016, R-018 (target size minimum and pointer cancellation explicitly required).
- R-020 (explicit focus destinations for Send/feedback and Try again transitions).

## Risk-sheet maintenance tasks

1. Keep only open risks R-017, R-022, and N-01 as active medium/serious items.
2. Keep resolved IDs listed above for traceability, but do not track them as active unless the spec regresses.
3. When spec text changes, re-check this file against Section 10 before adding new risks.
