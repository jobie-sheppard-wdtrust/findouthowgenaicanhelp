RisksofGenAI Spec — Patch Sheet (planning stage, no spec edits yet)

Source files used:
- RisksofGenAI-risksheet
- RisksofGenAI-Spec
- HB-spec-v2-patch-sheet

Purpose:
Define exactly what to change in RisksofGenAI-Spec to mitigate the currently open risk VCF-02 by reusing the same measurable-focus implementation pattern already approved in HB-spec-v2-patch-sheet (section C: N-01 — measurable focus appearance, Option A).

Final patch list (exact change instructions for RisksofGenAI-Spec)

A) VCF-02 — measurable focus appearance (copied implementation from HB patch)

1) In Section 10 under “Focus visibility:”, replace:
Current text:
- “A visible focus indicator is shown for every focusable control (including highlighted phrases) whenever it receives keyboard focus.”

Replace with:
- “All keyboard-focusable interactive elements MUST show a focus indicator that is at least 2 CSS pixels thick (or equivalent indicator area) and has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colours.”
- “The focus indicator MUST remain visible at 320px width and at 400% zoom, including in both main and feedback views.”
- “The focus indicator MUST NOT be fully obscured by the fixed header, overlays, or adjacent UI layers while focused.”

2) Keep existing focus-management/focus-obscuration requirements unchanged elsewhere in Section 10, including:
- “The pop-up must not obscure the focused element.”

3) Keep all existing keyboard-access rules unchanged:
- “All interactive controls are reachable using Tab/Shift+Tab.”
- “Enter and Space activate any button-like control.”
- “Any link-like control activates on Enter.”

Cross-check checklist before editing RisksofGenAI-Spec

1) Confirm the old non-measurable focus sentence is fully removed (no duplicate weaker variant remains).
2) Confirm the new 2px / 3:1 measurable rule appears exactly once in Section 10.
3) Confirm no contradiction with existing pop-up focus-obscuration and reflow requirements.
4) Confirm wording remains normative (MUST) and testable.
