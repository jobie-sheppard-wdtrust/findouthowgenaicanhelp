Theme code: VCF

VCF-02

Risk ID: VCF-02

Behaviour implied by spec: The accessibility section requires focus to be "visible" on every focusable control, but does not define measurable WCAG 2.2 focus appearance thresholds (minimum indicator area/perimeter and required contrast change).

Why this might fail WCAG (including WCAG 2.2 SC mapping): A developer can implement a technically "visible" focus style that is still too subtle or too small to satisfy WCAG 2.2 AA focus metrics. This leaves a real residual risk of failure for 2.4.13 Focus Appearance (AA), especially for compact controls and inline highlighted phrases.

Level of risk: Medium

Spec evidence (exact): "A visible focus indicator is shown for every focusable control (including highlighted phrases) whenever it receives keyboard focus."
